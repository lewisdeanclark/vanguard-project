# vanguard-project

**Goal**
Explore Vanguardâ€™s customer experience (CX) process data using Python to evaluate customer behaviours and outcomes across process steps.

**Questions**
1: Does the redesigned process (Test) lead to a higher completion rate compared to the existing process (Control)?
2: Do customer demographics (e.g., age group, gender, tenure) influence the likelihood of completing the process?

**Hypothesis**
1. Null Hypothesis - The completion rate in Control is equal to the completion rate in Test.
1. Alternative Hypothesis - The completion rate in Test is higher than the completion rate in Control.
